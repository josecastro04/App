**## App to transfer files between devices.

This is my first project in Java.
I'm using JavaFX for the GUI and Java's built-in networking library for the file transfer.

The app is still in development, I'm working on adding more features and improving the UI.

## Features
- Send files to another device
- Receive files from another device
- Delete files from the app
- Load Files from the app
- Save files to the app

## How to use
1. Start the app and create an account
2. Select the file you want to send
3. Open the app on the receiving device and log in
4. Select the file you want to receive
5. Click the "Download File" button to download the file
